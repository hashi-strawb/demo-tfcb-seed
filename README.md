# Terraform Cloud Seed Config

Configuring Terraform Cloud workspaces with Terraform Cloud, dynamically created
from YAML config files in the `./workspaces` directory.

Example:
```
type:         webserver
name:         lucytest
region:       london
image_height: 400
image_width:  560
image_type:   cat
```

The Terraform config in `main.tf` parses the YAML files in the `./workspaces`
directory and uses the values in this file to create new Workspaces in Terraform
Cloud (via a sub-module `./webserver-module`)

YAML files can be created directly, or via a GitHub Action:

https://github.com/hashi-strawb/demo-tfcb-seed/actions/workflows/create-webserver.yml

Workspaces use Terraform code from the `webserver/main.tf` directory, which will
spin up a placeholder webserver on an EC2 instance in AWS in either London or
Ireland.

## Configuring the Seed Workspace

The Seed workspace must be configured with the following Environment variables:
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` - AWS Credentials
* `TFE_TOKEN` A Terraform API Key

## Creating a new Workspace

In this example, creating a new workspace requires creating a new YAML file in the `workspaces/` directory of this repo, in the format defined above.

For the sake of making this easier for non-technical users, I have also set up a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/create-webserver.yml) for this, so users can fill in the details into a form, and then the Action is responsible for raising a Pull Request on the user's behalf:



## Caveats

This repo is meant as a Proof-of-Concept, rather than intended to be Production
Ready. If you intend to make use of the ideas used in this repo, you are free
to do so on the proviso that you understand how everything works, and fixing
any issues that may arise yourself. While HashiCorp support will be there for
any Terraform Enterprise/Cloud issues, they cannot be expected to understand or
support all possible configurations.

There is also no validation of parameters in the Terraform code, or GitHub Action.
While doable with Terraform, this is considered out-of-scope of this demo.

### Variables

In this example, I'm configuring resources in AWS, which means I need AWS credentials. In an ideal world, I'd be pulling these dynamically from Vault, but for the sake of a small isolated demo, I'm saving my (Vault-generated) credentials as environment variables within my Seed workspace.

The Seed workspace then copies those variables to the child workspaces. In this example, it uses an Environment Variable provider, as the values of these variables are sensitive. Unfortunately, by doing so, this means those variables are now persisted to my Terraform State. This would not normally be the case with Environment Variables.

A future improvement here would be to make use of the recently announced [Terraform Variable Sets](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-cloud-variable-sets-beta-now-available). AWS credentials would be defined there, and the relevant Variable Sets mapped to workspaces that need them.

Alas, as a newly announced feature, still in Beta, the TFE provider [does not yet support these](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-tfe/issues/391).
